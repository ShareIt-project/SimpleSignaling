# SimpleSignaling - Simple signaling protocol over WebSockets

Jesús Leganés Combarro "Piranna" - [piranna@gmail.com]

SimpleSignaling is a simple and minimalistic signaling protocol using WebSockets
and developed originally for the [ShareIt!](https://github.com/piranna/ShareIt)
project. It is highly indicate for [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org) applications.

If you will fork the project (and more if you want to do modifications) please
send me an email to let me know :-)

## How to use it

You just need to use simpleSignaling.js on the client and deploy a backend
server.js on a node.js enabled machine with WebSockets. It's recomended it also
has SSL.
